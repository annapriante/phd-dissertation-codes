    "This code is used to preprocess the text of the tweets before the use of the for the LIWC software for text analysis (Tausczik, Y. R., & Pennebaker, J. W. (2010). The Psychological Meaning of Words: LIWC and Computerized Text Analysis Methods. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29(1), 24â€“54. https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X09351676). LIWC already does the following processing steps: lowercase, grammar, capitalization, sentence structure. However, LIWC is limited in recognizing http, hashtags and @. This code is made to deal with the latter.\n",

    "The output can be saved in the same format and will return a tab-separated file with the TweetID, UserID and preprocessed text."
